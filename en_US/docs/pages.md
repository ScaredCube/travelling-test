# Other Jump Pages

In addition to the classic jump pages, there are also some jump pages created by maintenance team members and open source community contributors. You can consider using these jump pages when using and adding destinations. These jump pages are **equivalent** to classic jump pages, that is, under the premise of normal placement, no matter which jump page you use, your website can be identified by the detection crawler destined for it.

You can select your preferred jump page in [Travellings Preferences](https://www.travellings.cn/preference).

If you also want to make a jump page, please check out [Participation Project](https://www.travellings.cn/docs/join#参与项目)

## Simple Page

We still call this page as a "Simple Page", even though the original classic jump page is already simple.(~~note that the url is /plain.html~~)

## Go by Clouds 乘云而去

Real-time rendering of high-definition cloud effects; the blend of blue sky and Orbitron font creates an intoxicating post-modern atmosphere. The animation is smooth, and users can experience a seamless and smooth transition when switching pages.
