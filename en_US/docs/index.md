## About Travellings

**Travellings** project was established on March 12th, 2020. Its name came from the open network (kai wang) and Travellings is a "web-roll-like" friend link relay project.

The logo of "bound" is a star ring representing "the world" + a train representing "shuttle" - I believe you heard the word "bound" the most when you must be on the train, "The train from xx to xx..." ". ![example](https://www.travellings.cn/assets/logo-index.gif)

Hitherto, 1k+ people have starred the Travellings project, and 1k+ members have (or had) joined the project.
